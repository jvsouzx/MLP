# MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) - XOR Logic Gate
This repository contains a simple implementation of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) from scratch in a Jupyter Notebook to solve the classic XOR logical gate problem. The XOR problem is a fundamental task that demonstrates the ability of neural networks to solve non-linearly separable problems.

ðŸ§  Objective
Train a neural network to correctly learn the XOR truth table:

| Input 1 | Input 2 | Output |
| ------- | ------- | ------ |
| 0       | 0       | 0      |
| 0       | 1       | 1      |
| 1       | 0       | 1      |
| 1       | 1       | 0      |
